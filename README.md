This is a news app make purely in Kotlin and uses the Architecture Components, Dagger2 and RxJava

## Dagger-Android & RxJava

The app is built using `dagger.android` and `RxJava`. Below is the brief about the packages in the app:
  * `di` : This package contains all the files related to dependency injection
    * `component` : It contains the `AppComponent` that is responsible for generating all the code for injection and connecting the modules to injections.
    * `module` : It contains the Modules that provide the dependencies needed by the app.
    * `qualifier` : It contains the `ViewModelKey` `@MapKey` responsible for the injection in the `ViewModel`
  * `network` : This package contains a `NewsInterface` that is used by `Retrofit` to make network calls.
  * `ui` : It contains all the classes related to Android ui. For ex: `Activity`, `ViewModel`, `Adapter` etc.
    * `base` : Contains the `BaseActivity` that will be inherited by all the other activities.
    * `news` : Contains the `Activity` and `ViewModel` for the news.
  * `utils` : It contains the utility classes such as a `ClickListener`, `DataClasses` etc.
